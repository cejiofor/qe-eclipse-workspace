package com.perscholas.oop;
// Create another class and call it CarApp - check the box to include the “public static void main(String[ ] args)” method (if you forget to do this you can write the method yourself inside the class - see the example below). This will be the driver class since it will contain a main method
//Create an instance of the Car class in the main method of the driver class
//Three steps to creating an object/instance of a class:
//    declaration: a data type along with an instance name (e.g., Car car)
//    instantiation: the “new” keyword is used to create the object (i.e., instance)
//    initialization: the “new” keyword is followed by a call to a constructor which initializes the new object
//
//Example: Car car = new Car();
//
//Depending on your package structure, you may have to import the Car class to the driver class (the class with the main method), but Eclipse should prompt you to do this with an error warning
//Hover the cursor over the error
//You should see a description of the problem and some options to resolve it
//Choose the option to import the Car class from another package in your project
//The import statement should look something like this:
//
//import com.perscholas.oop.Car;
//
//Now let’s assign some values to the attributes/fields
//
//car.setMake("Ford");
//
//car.setModel(“Mustang");
//
//car.setYearBuilt(2017);
//
//Now retrieve these values and print them
//
//Output:
//
//Ford
//
//Mustang
//
//2017
//
